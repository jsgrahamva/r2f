	;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
	;;
	;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
	;;
	;;    Comment on:
	;;
	;;    1.  Describe date of onset, circumstances, and initial manifestations of
	;;        the disease or injury.  Report course of condition.
	;;    2.  For osteomyelitis:  location(s), frequency and dates of episodes of
	;;        active infection.  Were there constitutional symptoms with episodes of
	;;        active infection?  Is there current active infection?  If not, name
	;;        year of last active infection and how the infection was confirmed.
	;;    3.  History of hospitalizations or surgery, reason or type of surgery,
	;;        location and dates, if known.
	;;    4.  Symptoms of pain (location), weakness, stiffness, swelling, heat,
	;;        redness, drainage, fever, debility, instability or giving way,
	;;        "locking," abnormal motion, etc.  If motion of a joint is affected,
	;;        follow the JOINTS examination worksheet.       
	;;    5.  Hand dominance and how determined.
	;;    6.  Describe current treatment:  type, response, and side effects.
	;;    7.  If there are periods of flare-up of bone disease:
	;;
	;;        a.  State their severity, frequency, and duration.
	;;        b.  Name the precipitating and alleviating factors.
	;;        c.  Estimate to what extent, if any, per veteran, they affect
	;;            functional impairment during the flare-up.
	;;
	;;    8.  Describe whether crutches, brace, cane, walker, etc., are needed
	;;        to assist walking.
	;;    9.  History of neoplasm.
	;;
	;;        a.  Date of diagnosis, exact diagnosis.
	;;        b.  Benign or malignant.
	;;        c.  Type of treatment, dates.
	;;        d.  Last date of treatment.
	;;
	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;     Address each of the following as appropriate to the disability 
	;;     being examined and fully describe current findings:
	;;
	;;     1.  Describe objective evidence of deformity, angulation, loss of a
	;;         bone or part of a bone, malunion, nonunion, loose motion, false
	;;         joint, etc.
	;;     2.  For infection, describe tenderness, drainage, edema, effusion,
	;;         painful motion, intra-articular involvement, weakness, redness, heat.
	;;     3.  With joint involvement, a detailed assessment of each affected joint
	;;         is required.  Follow the JOINTS worksheet.
	;;     4.  For weight bearing joints (hip, knee, ankle), describe gait
	;;         and functional limitations on standing (in minutes or hours) and
	;;         walking (in yards or miles).  Describe any callosities, areas of
	;;         breakdown, or unusual shoe wear pattern that would indicate abnormal
	;;         weight bearing.
	;;     5.  If ankylosis is present, follow the JOINTS worksheet.
	;;     6.  If shortening of the leg may be present, measure the leg length
	;;         bilaterally from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial
	;;         malleolus.
	;;     7.  Are there constitutional signs of bone disease - anemia, weight loss,
	;;         fever, debility, amyloid liver, etc.?
	;;     8.  For genu recurvatum, acquired, traumatic:  Is there objective evidence
	;;         of weakness and insecurity on weight-bearing?
	;;     9.  For malunion of os calcis or astralgus - state degree of deformity
	;;         (mild, moderate, marked).
	;;     10. For a bone neoplasm, describe residuals of the neoplasm and its
	;;         treatment.
	;;
	;;D.   Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;     1.  As indicated:  X-rays, including special views or weight 
	;;         bearing films, MRI, arthrogram, diagnostic arthroscopy.  
	;;         NOTE:  The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis or post-traumatic
	;;         arthritis of a joint requires X-ray confirmation.  Once the 
	;;         diagnosis has been confirmed in a joint, further X-rays of that 
	;;         joint are not required.
	;;     2.  For osteomyelitis, state presence and location of any involucrum,
	;;         sequestrum, or draining sinus.
	;;     3.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests 
	;;         conducted in the examination report.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;     1.  Describe the effects of the condition on the veteran's usual
	;;         occupation and daily activities.
