	; This routine was created new for I13 (MVI_CR4999) DG*5.3*62 (cml and cmc).
	; It is called by a new option "ToolKit POC User Setup" [RG TK POC USER SETUP]
	; that calls a new RPC (MPI TK POC USER SETUP) that accesses the MPI to establish a Visitor Record in the New Person file (#200).
	; Just calling the RPC will establish the Visitor record if one didn't exist.  It will then update the ToolKit user with the
	; DUZ from the MPI, SSN and NT username.
	;
	; The RPC will identify any missing required fields in the New Person file and instruct the user to check their setup in the New Person
	; file to be sure they have Name, SSN ,Network Username and phone contact number.
	; - If a problem is detected they will need to use the Edit an Existing User option on the User Management menu or contact IRM if needed.
	; - If they have all the required fields the user will get a message back that all is good
