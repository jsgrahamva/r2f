	;;Narrative:  Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized
	;;by debilitating fatigue and several flu-like symptoms.  It may have 
	;;both physical and psychiatric manifestations and closely resembles 
	;;neurasthenia, neurocirculatory asthenia, fibrositis, or fibromyalgia. 
	;;
	;;   FOR VA PURPOSES, A DIAGNOSIS OF CFS MUST MEET BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
	;;
	;;   1.  New onset of debilitating fatigue that is severe enough to 
	;;       reduce or impair average daily activity below 50 percent of the
	;;       patient's pre-illness activity level for a period of 6 months, and
	;;   2.  Other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms 
	;;       must be excluded by thorough evaluation, based on history, 
	;;       physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.
	;;
	;;   IT MUST ALSO MEET SIX OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING TEN CRITERIA:
	;;
	;;   1.  Describe in detail:
	;;
	;;       a.  Acute onset of the condition.
	;;       b.  Low grade fever.
	;;       c.  Nonexudative pharyngitis.
	;;       d.  Palpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes.
	;;       e.  Generalized muscle aches or weakness.
	;;       f.  Fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise.
	;;       g.  Headaches (of a type, severity or pattern that is different
	;;           from headaches in the premorbid state).
	;;       h.  Migratory joint pains.
	;;       i.  Neuropsychologic symptoms.
	;;       j.  Sleep disturbance.
	;;
	;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
	;;
	;;    Comment on:
	;;
	;;    1.  Date diagnosis established.
	;;    2.  Does it meet the requirements outlined above?
	;;    3.  History of hospitalizations or surgery, reason or type of surgery,
	;;        location and dates, if known.
	;;
	;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
	;;
	;;    Comment on:
	;;
	;;    1.  Estimate the percentage of restriction of routine daily activities,
	;;        including employment if applicable, due to CFS.  State the duration
	;;        (in months) of this level of restriction and give specific examples
	;;        of activities that are restricted.
	;;    2.  State whether there is debilitating fatigue, whether it is constant
	;;        or nearly so, or if it waxes and wanes.  Does fatigue last 24 hours
	;;        or longer after exercise?
	;;    3.  State the total number of days of incapacitating episodes (defined as
	;;        requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician) due to CFS during the
	;;        past 12-month period.
	;;    4.  Describe symptoms of cognitive impairment, such as inability to
	;;        concentrate, forgetfulness, and confusion, and state their frequency
	;;        and whether they are constant or nearly so, or if they wax and wane.
	;;    5.  Describe other current symptoms, such as headaches, sleep disturbance,
	;;        fever, sore throat, generalized muscle aches or weakness, migratory
	;;        joint pains, or other neuropsychologic symptoms, and state their
	;;        frequency and whether they are constant or nearly so, or if they wax
	;;        and wane.  If headaches are present, are they of a type, severity, or
	;;        pattern that is different from headaches in the premorbid state?
	;;    6.  Does the patient require continuous medication for CFS?
	;;
	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    1.  General appearance.
	;;    2.  Describe evidence of pharyngitis and enlargement or tenderness of
	;;        cervical or axillary lymph nodes.
	;;    3.  Describe other significant abnormal physical findings.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
	;;        in the examination report.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
