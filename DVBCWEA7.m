	;;   6.  Capacity to handle financial affairs.  Mental competency, for VA
	;;       benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to manage
	;;       VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to any
	;;       other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes, means
	;;       that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable of
	;;       managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In order to
	;;       assist raters in making a legal determination as to competency, please
	;;       address the following:
	;;
	;;         What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
	;;         manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
	;;         things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
	;;         knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
	;;         the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the
	;;         bills himself or herself?
	;;
	;;         Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
	;;         of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
	;;         support your conclusion.
	;;
	;;         If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
	;;         can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
	;;         financial affairs, please explain why.
	;;
	;;Include your name; your credentials, (i.e., board certified psychiatrist,
	;;licensed psychologist; psychiatry resident or psychology intern,
	;;LCSW, or NP); and circumstances under which you performed the examination,
	;;if applicable (i.e., under the close supervision of an attending
	;;psychiatrist or psychologist); name of supervising psychiatrist or
	;;psychologist, if applicable.
