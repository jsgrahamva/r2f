	;;                      DEFINITION OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
	;;
	;;A traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of
	;;brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset
	;;or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately
	;;following the event:
	;;
	;;   -  Any period of loss of or a decreased level of consciousness;
	;;
	;;   -  Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after injury;
	;;
	;;   -  Any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion,
	;;      disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.);
	;;
	;;   -  Neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision,
	;;      praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not
	;;      be transient;
	;;
	;;   -  Intracranial lesion.
	;;
	;;External forces may include any of the following events:  the head being struck
	;;by an object, the head striking an object, the brain undergoing an
	;;acceleration/deceleration movement without direct external trauma to the head,
	;;a foreign body penetrating the brain, forces generated from events such as a
	;;blast or explosion, or other force yet to be defined.
	;;
	;;The above criteria define the event of a traumatic brain injury (TBI).
	;;Sequelae of TBI may resolve quickly, within minutes to hours after the
	;;neurological event, or they may persist longer.  Some sequelae of TBI may be
	;;permanent.  Most signs and symptoms will manifest immediately following the
	;;event.  However, other signs and symptoms may be delayed from days to months
	;;(e.g., subdural hematoma, seizures, hydrocephalus, spasticity, etc.).  Signs
	;;and symptoms may occur alone or in varying combinations and may result in a
	;;functional impairment.  These signs and symptoms are not better explained by
	;;pre-existing conditions or other medical, neurological, or psychological causes
	;;except in cases of an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.  These
	;;generally fall into one or more of the three following categories:
	;;
	;;   -  PHYSICAL:  Headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, sleep
	;;      disturbance, weakness, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, spasticity, aphasia,
	;;      dysphagia, dysarthria, apraxia, balance disorders, disorders of
	;;      coordination, seizure disorder.
	;;
	;;   -  COGNITIVE:  Attention, concentration, memory, speed of processing, new
	;;      learning, planning, reasoning, judgment, executive control, self-
	;;      awareness, language, abstract thinking.
	;;
	;;   -  BEHAVIORAL/EMOTIONAL:  Depression, anxiety, agitation, irritability,
	;;      impulsivity, aggression.
	;;
	;;Note:  The signs and symptoms listed above are typical of each category but
	;;are not an exhaustive list of all possible signs and symptoms.
	;;
	;;SEVERITY OF BRAIN INJURY STRATIFICATION:
	;;
	;;Not all individuals exposed to an external force will sustain a TBI.  TBI
	;;varies in severity, traditionally described as mild, moderate and severe.
	;;These categories are based on measures of length of unconsciousness, post-
	;;traumatic amnesia.
	;;
	;;The trauma may cause structural damage or may produce more subtle damage that
	;;manifests by altered brain function, without structural damage that can be
	;;detected by traditional imaging studies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or
	;;Computed Tomography scanning.  In addition to traditional imaging studies,
	;;other imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging,
	;;diffusion tensor imaging, positron emission tomography scanning, as well as
	;;electrophysiological testing such as electroencephalography may be used to
	;;detect damage to or physiological alteration of brain function.  In addition,
	;;altered brain function may be manifest by altered performance on neuro-
	;;psychological or other standardized testing of function.
	;;
	;;Acute injury severity is determined at the time of the injury, but this
	;;severity level, while having some prognostic value, does not necessarily
	;;reflect the patient's ultimate level of functioning.  It is recognized that
	;;serial assessments of the patient's cognitive, emotional, behavioral and
	;;social functioning is required.
	;;
	;;   -  The patient is classified as mild/moderate/severe if he or she meets any
	;;      of the criteria below within a particular severity level.  If a patient
	;;      meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the higher severity
	;;      level is assigned.
	;;
	;;   -  If it is not clinically possible to determine the brain injury level of
	;;      severity because of medical complications (e.g., medically induced coma),
	;;      other severity markers are required to make a determination of the
	;;      severity of the brain injury.

	;;It is recognized that the cognitive symptoms associated with post-traumatic
	;;stress disorder (PTSD) may overlap with symptoms of mild TBI.  Differential
	;;diagnosis of brain injury and PTSD is required for accurate diagnosis and
