	;;    1.  For all conditions, comment on:
	;;
	;;        a. Course, including onset of disorder, and any injury or
	;;           surgery (type and when carried out).  Past treatment.
	;;        b. Current treatment - type, effectiveness, side effects.
	;;        c. Symptoms.  
	;;        d. If surgery has been done, report effectiveness and any
	;;           residual or recurrent symptoms.
	;;
	;;    2.  For aortic aneurysm, aneurysm of any large artery, aneurysm of any
	;;        small artery, arteriovenous fistula, arteriosclerosis obliterans
	;;        and thromboangiitis obliterans, additionally comment on:
	;;
	;;        a. If lower extremities are affected, is there claudication,
	;;           and, if so, after how many yards of walking on level ground
	;;           at 2 miles per hour does it develop?  
	;;        b. Is there pain at rest?
	;;        c. Is exercise and exertion precluded by the condition?
	;;  
	;;    3.  For Raynaud's phenomenon, angioneurotic edema, and erythromelalgia,
	;;        additionally comment on:
	;;
	;;        a. Describe a characteristic attack.
	;;        b. Record the frequency, duration, and severity of
	;;           characteristic attacks.
	;;        c. State each part of the body that is affected.  For
	;;           angioneurotic edema, state whether laryngeal edema occurs
	;;           and how frequently.
	;;
	;;    4.  For Varicose veins and Post-phlebitic syndrome of any etiology,
	;;        additionally comment on:
	;;
	;;        a. Any history of ulcers and aching, fatigue, or abnormal sensations
	;;           in the leg at rest or after prolonged standing or walking. 
	;;        b. Are symptoms or edema relieved by elevation of the extremity,
	;;           compression hosiery, or other measures?  Is edema relieved
	;;           completely or only partially by elevation of the extremity?
	;;
	;;    5.  For soft tissue sarcoma or other malignant neoplasms of vascular
	;;      origin:
	;;
	;;        a. Record date of diagnosis and pathologic diagnosis.
	;;        b. Record type and dates of treatment.  If treatment has been
	;;           completed, state date of last treatment.
	;;        c. If treatment has been completed describe residual or recurrent
	;;             symptoms.
	;;
	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    1.  For aortic aneurysm, aneurysm of any large artery, aneurysm of any
	;;        small artery, or arteriovenous fistula:
	;;
	;;        a.  State diameter of aneurysm, cardiac status, including heart
	;;            size and rate.  For arteriovenous fistula, state pulse
	;;            pressure and whether there is evidence of high output failure.
	;;        b.  If extremities are affected, describe temperature and color,
	;;            pulses, trophic changes, ulcers (deep or superficial?), edema,
	;;            dermatitis, cellulitis.
	;;        c.  If lower extremities are affected, record ankle/brachial
	;;            index (using Doppler).
	;;        d.  If surgery has been carried out, describe residual findings,
	;;            using appropriate worksheet for the affected body system or
	;;            organ.
	;;
	;;    2.  For arteriosclerosis obliterans and thromboangiitis obliterans:
	;;
	;;        a.  Describe each affected extremity separately.
	;;        b.  Record ankle/brachial index (using Doppler).
	;;        c.  Describe temperature and color of extremities, pulses, trophic
	;;            changes, ulcers (deep or superficial?).
	;;        d.  If surgery has been carried out, describe any residuals or
	;;            side effects of surgery.
