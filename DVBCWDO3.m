	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    Address each of the following, as applicable, and fully describe:
	;;
	;;    1.  Tooth loss due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or mandible
	;;        (other than loss due to periodontal disease).  Describe the extent and
	;;        location of missing teeth and whether the masticatory surface can be
	;;        restored by a prosthesis.
	;;    2.  Loss of bone of the maxilla.  State extent (less than 25%, 25 to 50%,
	;;        more than 50%) and whether loss is replaceable by a prosthesis.
	;;    3.  Malunion or nonunion of the maxilla and extent of displacement (none,
	;;        mild, moderate, severe).
	;;    4.  Loss of bone of the mandible.  State side or sides affected and extent:
	;;        a. Complete loss, between angles.
	;;        b. Loss of half of mandible involving temporomandibular articulation.
	;;        c. Loss of half of mandible not involving temporomandibular
	;;           articulation.
	;;        d. Loss of part or all of ramus involving loss of temporomandibular
	;;           articulation.
	;;        e. Loss of part or all of ramus not involving loss of temporomandibular
	;;           articulation.
	;;        f. Loss of less than one-half of ramus with loss of continuity.
	;;        g. Loss of less than one-half of ramus without loss of continuity.
	;;        h. Loss of condyloid process.
	;;        i. Loss of coronoid process.
	;;
	;;        State if loss is replaceable by prosthesis.
	;;    5.  Nonunion of the mandible, extent of abnormal motion (none, mild,
	;;        moderate, severe), and extent of interference with masticatory function
	;;        (none, mild, moderate, severe).
	;;    6.  Malunion of the mandible, extent of displacement (none, mild, moderate,
	;;        severe), extent of abnormal motion (none, mild, moderate, severe), and
	;;        extent of interference with masticatory function (none, mild, moderate,
	;;        severe).
	;;    7.  Loss of bone of hard palate.  State side(s), extent of loss of the
	;;        entire palate (less than half, half, more than half), and state whether
	;;        loss is replaceable by prosthesis.
	;;    8.  Evidence of osteoradionecrosis of maxilla, mandible, or both.
	;;    9.  Evidence of osteomyelitis of maxilla, mandible, or both.
	;;   10.  Speech difficulty and extent.
	;;   11.  Limitation of motion at the temporomandibular articulation.
	;;        a. Report inter-incisal range of motion (O to X mm.) and range of
	;;           lateral excursion (O to X mm.) on the left and right sides.
	;;        b. Describe objective evidence of pain in the affected joint/joints at
	;;           rest and during active range of motion.
	;;        c. Have the veteran move the affected joint/joints through repetitive
	;;           active range of motion as tolerated (at least 3 repetitions).
	;;        d. After repetitions, re-measure the range of motion of the affected
	;;           joint/joints.
	;;        e. If there is additional loss of the range of motion after the
	;;           repetitions, report the range of motion and state whether pain,
	;;           fatigue, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination is the most
	;;           important factor in the additional loss of motion.
	;;        f. If repetitive active range of motion of a joint cannot be done,
	;;            state so and give the reason.
	;;   12.  If there is or was a related neoplasm, report residuals of the neoplasm
	;;        and its treatment.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;    Provide:
	;;
	;;      1.  X-ray to determine extent of bone tissue loss.
	;;      2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
	;;          in the examination report.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;    1.  Where there is loss of teeth due to loss of substance of body  of 
	;;        maxilla or mandible, state etiology.
	;;    2.  If there is speech difficulty, state etiology.
	;;    3.  State effects of the condition on occupational functioning and daily
	;;        activities.
