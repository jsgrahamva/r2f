	;;Narrative: This is the protocol for conducting initial examinations on former 
	;;POWs.  Approach these veterans with the greatest sensitivity because the 
	;;POW experience likely resulted in a great deal of psychological and physical 
	;;trauma.  Details about beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, 
	;;disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, and anxiety may be 
	;;significant parts of the veteran's history; eliciting these details requires  
	;;that one establish a trusting relationship with the veteran. Examine
	;;veteran for each disability / disease / condition veteran is claiming 
	;;as a consequence of the POW experience.  A former POW may be entitled 
	;;to service connection for presumptive POW diseases; the worksheet contains
	;;a list of these presumptive diseases.  Based on veteran's claim(s) and your
	;;findings, please refer to and follow additional worksheets to assure
	;;the examination  provides information adequate for rating purposes.
	;;
	;;
	;;
	;;PRESUMPTIVE POW DISABILITIES:

	;;    2.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  (Per the rating schedule, hypertension means that the
	;;        diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and
	;;        isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure
	;;        is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of
	;;        less than 90mm.).
	;;
	;;        i.  If the diagnosis of hypertension has not been previously
	;;            established, and it is a claimed issue, B.P. readings must be
	;;            taken two or more times on each of at least three different days.
	;;       ii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed and is claimed, but
	;;            the claimant is not on treatment, B.P. readings must be taken two
	;;            or more times on at least three different days.
	;;      iii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed, and the claimant is
	;;            on treatment, take three blood pressure readings on the day of the
	;;            examination.
	;;       iv.  If hypertension has not been claimed, take three blood pressure
	;;            readings on the day of the examination.  If they are suggestive of
	;;            hypertension or are borderline, readings must be taken two or more
	;;            times on at least two additional days to rule hypertension in or
	;;            out.
	;;        v.  In the diagnostic summary, state whether hypertension is ruled in
	;;            or out after completing these B.P. measurements.  If hypertensive
	;;            heart disease is suspected or found, follow worksheet for Heart.
