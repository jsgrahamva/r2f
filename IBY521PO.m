DOC	;
	; HPID Build 1 created 4 new fields in file 36.  
	; 2 had cross-references which were set up to allow as look-ups.
	; Build 2 changes those cross-references to be non-lookup.
	; This change requires they now start with "A":
	; 8.01 - HPID/OEID - was "HOD", now will be "AHOD"
	; 8.04 - NID IF - was "NIF", now will be "ANIF"
	;
	; PRINDX^IBY521PR will run in the pre-install to delete old x-refs
	; POINDX^IBY521PO will run post-install to set in new format
	;
POINDX	; POST-INSTALL comes here
	; run triggers on new cross-refs for fields 8.01 & 8.04 (AHOD & ANIF)
