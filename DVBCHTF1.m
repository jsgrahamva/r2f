	;;         (Per Veteran).
	;;
	;;C. Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;   1.  Digit and joint designations:
	;;
	;;       a. Designate fingers as: thumb, index, long, ring, and little.
	;;       b. Designate joints as DIP (distal interphalangeal), PIP (proximal
	;;          (interphalangeal), MP (metacarpophalangeal), and CP (carpometacarpal).
	;;
	;;   2.  Hand "position of function":
	;;
	;;       a. Wrist dorsiflexed 20 to 30 degrees.
	;;       b. MP and PIP joints flexed to 30 degrees.
	;;       c. Thumb abducted and rotated so that the thumb pad faces the finger
	;;          pads.
	;;
	;;   3.  Instructions for joint measurement:
	;;
	;;       a. Provide a detailed assessment of each joint of each affected digit.
	;;       b. Use a goniometer for measuring joint angles and range of motion.
	;;       c. Assess joints on both left and right hands, even if only one hand is
	;;          affected.
	;;       d. Refer to Residuals of Amputations worksheet, if applicable.
	;;
	;;   4.  Normal range of motion for index, long, ring, and little fingers:
	;;
	;;       a. Zero degrees of flexion represents the fingers fully extended, making
	;;          a straight line with the rest of the hand.
	;;       b. Metacarpophalangeal joint:  zero to 90 degrees of flexion.
	;;       c. Proximal interphalangeal joint:  zero to 100 degrees of flexion.
	;;       d. Distal (terminal) interphalangeal joint:  zero to 70 or 80 degrees
	;;          of flexion.
	;;
	;;   5.  Range of motion (ROM) examination of index, long, ring, and little
	;;       fingers:
	;;
	;;       a. Measure active ROM of DIP, PIP, and MP joints.
	;;       b. For index and long finger, also report size of gap between fingertip
	;;          and proximal transverse crease of hand on maximal flexion of finger
	;;          (none, less than one inch, one inch, etc.).
	;;       c. State whether there is objective evidence of pain on active ROM.
	;;       d. Conduct at least 3 repetitions of ROM.
	;;       e. State whether there is objective evidence of pain after repetitive
	;;          ROM.
	;;       f. State whether there is additional (or new) limitation of motion
	;;          (including whether there is an increased gap between fingertip and
	;;          hand for index and long fingers) after repetitive ROM.  If there is,
	;;          report the ROM (and size of gap) and state whether pain, weakness,
	;;          incoordination, fatigue, or lack of endurance is the most important
	;;          factor in the decreased ROM.
	;;       g. If unable to do repetitive motion, so state and provide reason.
	;;
	;;   6.  Range of motion (ROM) examination of thumb:
	;;
	;;       a. Report size of gap between the thumb pad and the fingers (none, less
	;;          than one inch, one inch, etc.), with the thumb attempting to oppose
	;;          the fingers.
	;;       b. State whether there is objective evidence of pain on attempted
	;;          opposition of thumb to fingers.
	;;       c. Conduct at least 3 repetitions of ROM.
	;;       d. State whether there is objective evidence of pain after repetitive
	;;          ROM.
	;;       e. State whether there is additional (or new) limitation of motion after
	;;          repetitive ROM.  If there is, report the ROM (gap) and state whether
	;;          pain, weakness, incoordination, fatigue, or lack of endurance is the
	;;          most important factor in the decreased ROM.
	;;       f. If unable to do repetitive motion, so state and provide reason.
	;;
	;;   7.  Ankylosis examination:
	;;
	;;   For each anklyosed joint:
	;;
	;;       a. Report angle of anklyosis.
	;;       b. Describe any rotation or any angulation of either bone at an
	;;          anklyosed joint.
	;;       c. State whether the ankylosis interferes with motion of the other
	;;          digits or with overall hand function.
	;;       d. For thumb:  Additionally state whether the ankylosed thumb is
	;;          abducted and rotated so that the thumb pad faces the finger pad.
	;;          Report size of gap between the thumb pad and the fingers (none, less
	;;          than one inch, one inch, etc.).
	;;       e. For index, long, ring, and little fingers:  Additionally report size
	;;          of gap between the finger and the proximal transverse crease of hand
	;;          on maximal flexion of finger (none, less than one inch, one inch,
	;;          etc.).
	;;
	;;    8.  If there is deformity of one or more digits, state digit, joint, and
	;;        type of deformity, including degrees of any angulation.
	;;
	;;    9.  Describe any decreased strength for pushing, pulling and twisting.
	;;        Describe any decreased dexterity for twisting, probing, writing,
	;;        touching and expression.
	;;
	;;D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;   1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in
	;;       the examination report, including X-ray or other imaging studies, as
	;;       needed.
	;;
	;;E. Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;   1.  Describe the effects of the condition on usual occupation and daily
	;;       activities.
