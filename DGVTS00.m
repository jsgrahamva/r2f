DGVTS00	;7DELTA/KDC - VTS Stand alone Option routine ;07-MAR-2012
	;;5.3;REGISTRATION;**853**;07-MAR-2012;Build 104
	Q
	; This routine was built for the Veterans Transportation Service (VTS) project.
	; A flat file is created from the RouteMatch database containing its Veteran population. 
	; The flat file will contain Veteran name, address and phone number. The routine reads 
	; a record from the flat file and tries to find the corresponding Veteran in VistA. 
	; A match is only made if all fields (name, city, state, zip code and phone number) match.
	; Otherwise the record that was read in is written out to an exception report file 
	; containing Veteran's for whom the process could not determine a match. If a match 
	; is found then the ICN associated with the Veteran is appended to the record that 
	; was read in and written out to the output file. The output file will be sent to 
	; RouteMatch to be loaded into their database.
