MESSBULL	;Message contents of the XM DOMAIN bulletin
	;;This site has just received an incoming transmission from  
	;;'|2|'. Since we have no record of this domain 
	;;in the DOMAIN file 4.2, and did not find '|1|' in the 
	;;INTERNET SUFFIX file 4.2996, we have added '|1|' to the 
	;;DOMAIN file.
	;;
	;;If you think this domain should be added to file 4.2996, 
	;;please enter a trouble ticket. Only internationally recognized internet 
	;;suffixes should be added to file 4.2996, and then only via 
	;;a MailMan patch. 
	;;
	;;If you think this domain may be a poorly named VHA domain, 
	;;please enter a trouble ticket. All new VHA domains should end in 
	;;'.DOMAIN.EXT'.
	;;QUIT
DESCBULL	;Description contents of the XM DOMAIN bulletin
	;;This bulletin is sent to alert IRM to the new domain. This shouldn't happen 
	;;very often, and if it does, the domain name should be investigated. 
	;;
	;;If you think that it is a bad name, enter a trouble ticket so it can be investigated. 
	;;
	;;If this new top-level domain is a valid internet suffix, it should be
	;;deleted from the DOMAIN file and added to file 4.2996, INTERNET SUFFIX,
	;;and a trouble ticket should be entered for MailMan, so that a patch can be sent
	;;out to add this top-level domain to file 4.2996 at every site.
