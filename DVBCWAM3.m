	;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
	;;
	;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
	;;
	;;    1.  Describe type of arrhythmia and onset of disorder.  Indicate whether
	;;        arrhythmia is intermittent or continuous.
	;;    2.  Describe hospitalization or surgery for arrhythmia, including location,
	;;        date, type of surgery, reason for hospitalization.
	;;    3.  For intermittent arrhythmia, state frequency and duration of episodes,
	;;        and for supraventricular arrhythmia, state how many episodes per year
	;;        have been confirmed by EKG or Holter monitor?
	;;    4.  Is a pacemaker present?  If so, when was it inserted, effectiveness,
	;;        side effects?
	;;    5.  Is an AICD (automatic implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) present?
	;;        If so, when was it implanted, effectiveness, side effects?
	;;    6.  Describe other treatment, including RF (radiofrequency) ablation, type,
	;;        effectiveness, and side effects?  Is continuous medication required?
	;;    7.  Is there a history of congestive heart failure?  If so, state whether
	;;        chronic or not.  If not chronic, how many episodes have there been in
	;;        the past 12 months?
	;;    8.  Sustained ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular
	;;        block, and implantable cardiac pacemakers (if ventricular
	;;        arrhythmia or atrioventricular block was the reason for the
	;;        pacemaker) require that the examiner provide the METs level,
	;;        determined by exercise testing, at which symptoms of dyspnea, 
	;;        fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope result.
	;;
	;;        Exercise testing is not required for these 3 conditions in the
	;;        following circumstances:
	;;
	;;           a.  If exercise testing is medically contraindicated:
	;;
	;;               i.  In that case, provide the medical reason exercise
	;;                   testing cannot be conducted, and
	;;              ii.  Provide an estimate of the level of activity
	;;                   (expressed in METs and supported by specific
	;;                   examples, such as slow stair climbing, or
	;;                   shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue,
	;;                   angina, dizziness, or syncope.
	;;
	;;           b.  If left ventricular dysfunction is present, and the 
	;;               ejection fraction is 50 percent or less.
	;;           c.  If there is chronic congestive heart failure or there
	;;               has been more than one episode of acute congestive
	;;               heart failure in the past year.
	;;           d.  With valvular heart disease - during active infection
	;;               with valvular heart damage and for three months
	;;               following cessation of therapy for the active 
	;;               infection.
	;;           e.  With endocarditis - for three months following
	;;               cessation of therapy for active infection with cardiac
	;;               involvement.
	;;           f.  With pericarditis - for three months following
	;;               cessation of therapy for active infection with cardiac
	;;               involvement.
	;;           g.  With myocardial infarction - for three months
	;;               following myocardial infarction.
	;;           h.  With valve replacement - for six months following date
	;;               of hospital admission for valve replacement.
	;;           i.  With coronary bypass surgery - for three months
	;;               following hospital admission for surgery.
	;;           j.  For cardiac transplantation - for indefinite period
	;;               from date of hospital admission for cardiac
	;;               transplantation.
	;;           k.  If an exercise test has been done within the past
	;;               year, the results are of record, and there is no
	;;               indication that there has been a change in the cardiac
	;;               status of the veteran since.
	;;
	;;    9.  Other significant history.
	;;
	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
	;;
	;;    1.  Vital signs; heart size and method of determination; heart
	;;        sounds, rate and rhythm, blood pressure.
	;;    2.  Status of cardiac function - evidence of congestive heart
	;;        failure.
	;;    3.  Other significant physical findings.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;  
	;;    1.  EKG.
	;;    2.  Was testing for left ventricular function done?  If so,
	;;        report the ejection fraction.
	;;    3.  Holter monitor, other tests as indicated.
	;;    4.  Chest X-ray or other imaging study, exercise stress test,
	;;        echocardiogram, Holter monitor, thallium study, angiography,
	;;        etc., as appropriate, and as required or indicated.
	;;    5.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests
	;;        conducted in the examination report, including status of
	;;        left ventricular function, if measured.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;  
	;;    1.  Type of cardiac arrhythmia, if present.  Confirmed by EKG or
	;;        Holter monitor?
	;;    2.  Other diagnoses.
	;;    3.  Describe the effects of each diagnosed condition on the
	;;        veteran's usual occupation and daily activities.
