ENV	; - environment check for patch (needs to stay on top of routine)
	;   This is to double check the site correctly setup the WSDL
	;   when patch MPIF*1*56 was released.  This may cause a hard
	;   M error when executing but it is better we catch this during
	;   the patch load process than after the patch is installed and
	;   registration users are getting errors.
	;
	N RETURN
	; - check for production system, these checks can only be done there
	I '$$PROD^XUPROD Q
