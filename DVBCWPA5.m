	;;   12.  CARDIAC:  Record heart sounds, including any extra heart sounds,
	;;        rhythm, PMI.  Indicate if there is evidence of congestive heart
	;;        failure or pulmonary hypertension.  (NOTE:  A determination of METs
	;;        by exercise testing may be required for certain cardiovascular
	;;        conditions, and an estimation of METs may be required if exercise
	;;        testing cannot be conducted for medical reasons.  If there is evidence
	;;        of a cardiovascular condition, or one is claimed, refer to appropriate
	;;        worksheets.).
	;;
	;;   13.  ABDOMEN/GASTROINTESTINAL:  Report abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, mass,
	;;        tenderness, guarding, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, etc.  If there is a
	;;        hernia, describe type, location, size, whether complete, reducible,
	;;        recurrent, supported by truss or belt, and whether or not operable.
	;;        If there are hemorrhoids, state whether they are internal or external,
	;;        whether bleeding or prolapse (state whether reducible) is present, and
	;;        whether thrombosis or fissure is present.  If there are periods of
	;;        incapacitation due to a gastrointestinal condition, state total number
	;;        of days of incapacitation (requiring bedrest and treatment by a
	;;        physician) during the past 12-month period.
	;;
	;;   14.  GENITOURINARY:  For males, report abnormality of penis, testicles,
	;;        epididymis, seminal vesicles, spermatic cord and prostate gland.
	;;        Include rectal examination.  For males and females, if there is a
	;;        urinary fistula, describe extent of leakage and need for catheter or
	;;        number of absorbent pads required per day.
	;;   
	;;   15.  GYNECOLOGIC:  Report abnormality on pelvic examination of labia,
	;;        introitus, vagina, cervix, uterus, adnexa and ovaries.  Perform Pap
	;;        smear (if none within past year).  If unable to conduct an examination
	;;        and Pap smear, or if there is a severe or complex problem, refer to a
	;;        specialist.
	;;
	;;   16.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  If there is limitation of motion of one or more
	;;        joints, a detailed assessment of each affected joint is required.
	;;        Using a goniometer, measure the active range of motion in degrees.
	;;        State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.  After at
	;;        least 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there are
	;;        additional limitations of range of motion and whether there is
	;;        objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most important
	;;        factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance, incoordination)
	;;        for any additional loss of motion after repetitive motion.  Report
	;;        the range of motion after the repetitions.  (See the appropriate
	;;        musculoskeletal worksheet (feet, spine, etc.) for more details.)
	;;
	;;        Describe spasm, atrophy, or other muscle abnormalities.  For atrophy,
	;;        report measurements bilaterally.  Report any loss of muscle strength
	;;        using the standard muscle strength grading system (0 = absent.  No
	;;        muscle movement felt; 1 = trace.  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but
	;;        no movement produced; 2 = poor.  Muscle movement produced only with
	;;        gravity eliminated; 3 = fair.  Muscle movement produced against
	;;        gravity but cannot overcome resistance; 4 = good.  Muscle movement
	;;        produced against some resistance, but not against "normal" resistance;
	;;        5 = normal.  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.).
	;;
	;;        If there has been a fracture, describe location and any residuals,
	;;        such as malunion, deformity, ankylosis, etc.  If there has been an
	;;        amputation, follow the Residuals of Amputation worksheet.
	;;
	;;        If foot problems exist, also report painful motion, swelling, callus,
	;;        tenderness, instability, weakness, spasm, rigidity, and circulatory
	;;        disturbance.  Report foot or toe deformities such as pes cavus,
	;;        hammertoes, or hallux valgus.  If there is flatfoot:  report whether
	;;        there is pronation; the status of the arch; whether the weight bearing
	;;        line is over or medial to the great toe; the Achilles, forefoot, and
	;;        midfoot alignment; whether there is pain at rest or on manipulation;
	;;        and whether a malalignment is correctable by manipulation.
	;;
	;;   17.  EXTREMITIES:  Describe abnormalities such as ulcers, cyanosis,
	;;        clubbing, stasis dermatitis, gangrene, trophic changes, varicose veins,
	;;        calf tenderness, edema, and decreased or absent pulses.  If there is
	;;        edema, is it relieved by elevation of extremities?
	;;
	;;   18.  ENDOCRINE:  Describe neck mass or nodule, lid lag or exophthalmos,
	;;        abnormalities of hair or skin, or abnormalities of other body systems
	;;        due to endocrine disease.
	;; 
	;;   19.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Assess orientation and memory, gait, stance, and 
	;;        coordination, speech, cranial nerve functions.  Assess deep tendon
	;;        reflexes, pain, touch, temperature, vibration, and position, motor and
	;;        sensory status of peripheral nerves.  If neurological abnormalities
	;;        are found on examination, or there is a history of seizures, refer to
	;;        appropriate worksheet.
	;;
	;;   20.  PSYCHIATRIC:  Describe affect, mood, judgment, behavior, comprehension
	;;        of commands, hallucinations or delusions, and intelligence.  This is
	;;        meant to be a brief screening examination.  If a mental disorder is
	;;        claimed, or suspected based on the screening examination, request a
	;;        mental disorder or PTSD examination conducted by a specialist.
	;;
	;;   21.  BREAST:  Describe mass or diffuse nodularity, nipple abnormalities,
	;;        gynecomastia, residuals of surgery, axillary lymphadenopathy, and skin
	;;        abnormalities.  Report whether there is a significant difference in
	;;        size or contour between the breasts.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic And Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the
	;;        examination report.
	;;    2.  Review all test results before providing the summary and diagnosis.
	;;    3.  Follow additional worksheets, as appropriate.
	;;    4.  Request tests as indicated - e.g., parasite studies, X-rays of joints,
	;;        etc.  The diagnosis of degenerative or traumatic arthritis of any
	;;        joint requires X-ray confirmation, but once confirmed by X-ray, either
	;;        in service or after service, no further X-rays of that joint are
	;;        required for disability evaluation purposes.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;    1.  All laboratory and diagnostic tests should be completed and reviewed
	;;        prior to completing the summary of findings.
	;;    2.  The POW Physician Coordinator should complete summary of findings,
	;;        diagnoses, and recommendations.  The Coordinator should also express
	;;        an opinion, with supporting reasons, concerning the relationship
	;;        between the veteran's experiences as a POW and each current medical
	;;        condition.  If osteoarthritis is diagnosed, it should be clarified
	;;        whether this is post-traumatic osteoarthritis, and, if so, whether it
	;;        is related to the period of confinement.
	;;    3.  State whether any specialist examinations are indicated and whether
	;;        any have been requested.
	;;    4.  For each condition diagnosed, describe its effect on the veteran's
	;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
	;;    5.  CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS:  Mental competency, for VA
	;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
	;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to
	;;        any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
	;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
	;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
	;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
	;;        competency, please address the following:
	;;
	;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
	;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
	;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
	;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
	;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
	;;        himself or herself?
	;;
	;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
	;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
	;;        support your conclusion.
	;;
	;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
	;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
	;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
