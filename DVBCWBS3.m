	;;Narrative:  In some cases, assessment of the residuals of brain or spinal
	;;cord disease or injury will require following examination worksheets in other
	;;body systems or referring for a specialist examination (for Eye, Hearing,
	;;or Mental Disorders).  For example, bladder impairment may require assessment
	;;under the Genitourinary worksheet guidelines.  Vision problems will require a
	;;specialist eye examination.  Other examination worksheets for the nervous
	;;system (cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, epilepsy and narcolepsy) may need
	;;to be followed for thorough assessment.
	;;
	;;A.  Review of Medical Records:  Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.

	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
	;;
	;;    1.  If a neoplasm is or was present, describe residuals of the neoplasm
	;;        and its treatment.
	;;    2.  Describe specific functional motor impairment of affected areas (for
	;;        example, weakness of flexion of left elbow (3/5 strength for flexors),
	;;        complete paralysis (0/5) of all muscle groups of left lower extremity).
	;;        Use standard muscle strength grading system:  0 = absent.  No muscle
	;;        movement felt; 1 = trace.  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but no
	;;        movement produced; 2 = poor.  Muscle movement produced only with
	;;        gravity eliminated; 3 = fair.  Muscle movement produced against
	;;        gravity but cannot overcome resistance; 4 = good.  Muscle movement
	;;        produced against some resistance, but not against "normal" resistance;
	;;        5 = normal.  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.
	;;    3.  Describe abnormality of muscle tone and any muscle atrophy (give left
	;;        and right side measurements).
	;;    4.  Reflexes.  Use deep tendon reflex grading system (0 = absent, 1+ =
	;;        hypoactive, 2+ = normal, 3+ = hyperactive, without clonus, 4+ =
	;;        hyperactive, with clonus).  Report bilateral reflexes of biceps (C5-6),
	;;        triceps (C6-8), brachioradialis (C5-6), finger jerk (C8-T1), abdominal
	;;        (T8-T12), knee jerk (L3-4), ankle jerk (S1), plantar (Babinski).
	;;    5.  If there is loss of sensory function of a nerve or group of nerves,
	;;        report the location, modality of sensation affected, and whether
	;;        decreased or absent.
	;;    6.  If cranial nerve function is affected, follow the Cranial Nerves
	;;        worksheet.
	;;    7.  Describe in detail any functional impairment of the autonomic nervous
	;;        system.
	;;    8.  If there is limitation of motion of one or more joints, a detailed
	;;        assessment of each affected joint is required.
	;;
	;;        Using a goniometer, measure the active range of motion in degrees.
	;;        State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.  After
	;;        at least 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there
	;;        are additional limitations of range of motion and whether there is
	;;        objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most important
	;;        factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance, incoordination)
	;;        for any additional loss of motion after repetitive motion.  Report
	;;        the range of motion after the repetitions.  (See the appropriate
	;;        musculoskeletal worksheet for more details.).
	;;    9.  If there is speech impairment, state to what extent veteran is able
	;;        to be understood (unable to be understood, able to be understood less
	;;        than half the time, able to be understood half of the time or more
	;;        but not always, able to be understood all of the time except for a
	;;        few words or only occasionally not understood).
	;;    10. Describe any psychiatric or cognitive manifestations in detail - see
	;;        worksheets for mental disorders (but when traumatic brain injury is
	;;        present, also see the Traumatic Brain Injury worksheet to assess
	;;        cognitive impairment).
	;;    11. Describe tremors or fasciculation, gait, balance, cerebellar signs.
	;;    12. Eye examination - follow Eye worksheet.  Requires specialist to
	;;        conduct examination if there are eye complaints or findings.
	;;    13. State if the veteran has bladder or bowel functional impairment.  For
	;;        bowel impairment, state whether leakage is evident and the status of
	;;        the sphincter (normal, decreased tone, absent tone).  For bladder
	;;        impairment, state whether leakage is evident and describe any
	;;        complications (follow the Genitourinary worksheet if indicated).
	;;    14. If smell or taste is affected, also complete the worksheet for Sense
	;;        of Smell and Taste.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;    1.  Skull X-rays to measure bony defect, if there was surgery; 
	;;        spine X-rays if there was spinal cord surgery.
	;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
	;;        in the examination report.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;    1.  State diagnosis or diagnoses.
	;;    2.  For each condition diagnosed, describe the effects on the veteran's
	;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
	;;    3.  Capacity to Manage Financial Affairs:  Mental competency, for VA
	;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
	;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not to
	;;        any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
	;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
	;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
	;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
	;;        competency, please address the following:
	;;
	;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
	;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
	;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
	;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
	;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
	;;        himself or herself?
	;;
	;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
	;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
	;;        support your conclusion.
	;;
	;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
	;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
	;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
