PRI1	;B.      If any contractor/sub-contractor retained to do work for VA under
	;this Contract requires access, use, etc., of VA SPI as aforesaid, and if an
	;actionable data breach occurs because of the contractor/subcontractor's acts, 
	;omissions, or negligence in following the VA-directed security controls, 
	;enhancements, compensating controls, protocols, and/or measures, including,
	;but not limited to the sources above, the contractor/subcontractor is 
	;further subject to the statutory requirement to assess liquidated damages 
	;against contractors and/or subcontractors under 38 U.S.C. §5725 in the event

	;compromises not only the information's security or privacy but that of the
	;Veteran or beneficiary as well as the potential exposure or wrongful 
	;disclosure of such information as a result of a failure to follow proper 
	;data security controls and protocols.
