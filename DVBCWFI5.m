	;;Narrative:  For VA compensation purposes, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia 
	;;(sometimes called fibrositis, primary fibromyalgia syndrome, or 
	;;myofascial pain syndrome) requires the presence of widespread 
	;;musculoskeletal pain and tender points.  Additional findings may also
	;;be present:  fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, paresthesias, 
	;;headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression, anxiety, or Raynaud's
	;;-like symptoms.  Widespread pain is defined as pain in both the left 
	;;and right sides of the body, that is both above and below the waist, 
	;;and that affects both the axial skeleton (i.e., cervical spine, 
	;;anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back) and the extremities.  
	;;Rule out other diagnostic entities that may be responsible for the 
	;;symptomatology presented.

	;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
	;;
	;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
	;;
	;;    Comment on:
	;;
	;;    1.  Date and circumstances of onset.
	;;    2.  History of hospitalizations or surgery, dates and locations, if known,
	;;        and reason.
	;;    3.  Report which of the following are present:  Unexplained fatigue, sleep
	;;        disturbances, headaches, paresthesias, diarrhea, constipation,
	;;        alternating constipation and diarrhea, abdominal cramps or bloating,
	;;        depression, anxiety, Raynaud's-like symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms.
	;;    4.  For musculoskeletal symptoms, describe type (myalgia, arthralgia,
	;;        stiffness, etc.) and location.  State whether pain, if present, is
	;;        widespread (meaning in both the left and right sides of the body, both
	;;        above and below the waist, and that affects both the axial skeleton
	;;        (i.e., cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back)
	;;        and the extremities).
	;;    5.  State whether symptoms are constant, or nearly so, or are episodic.
	;;        If episodic, are they present more than one-third of the time?
	;;    6.  What precipitates or exacerbates symptoms?
	;;    7.  Treatment, (type, duration, response, side effects).  Is continuous
	;;        medication required for control?  Are symptoms refractory to therapy?
	;;
	;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
	;;
	;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
	;;
	;;    1.  Vital signs.
	;;    2.  Indicate all tender points found (and state if on left, right, or both
	;;        sides) from the following list of fibromyalgia tender points
	;;        identified by the American College of Rheumatology.
	;;        Occiput:  at the suboccipital muscle insertions.
	;;        Low cervical:  at the anterior aspects of the intertransverse spaces
	;;        at C5-C7.
	;;        Trapezius:  at the midpoint of the upper border.
	;;        Supraspinatus:  at origins, above the scapula spine near the medial
	;;        border.
	;;        Second rib:  at the second costochondral junctions, just lateral to
	;;        the junctions on upper surfaces.
	;;        Lateral epicondyle:  2 cm distal to the epicondyles.
	;;        Gluteal:  in upper outer quadrants of buttocks in anterior fold of
	;;        muscle.
	;;        Greater trochanter:  posterior to the trochanteric prominence.
	;;        Knee:  at the medial fat pad proximal to the joint line.
	;;
	;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
	;;
	;;    1.  As appropriate, to rule out other conditions.
	;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
	;;        in the examination report.
	;;
	;;E.  Diagnosis:
	;;
	;;    1.  Diagnosis and date of diagnosis, if known.
	;;    2.  Is the condition currently active or in remission?
	;;    3.  State amount of time lost from work during past 12-month period due to
	;;        fibromyalgia.
	;;    4.  Describe the effects of the condition on usual occupation and daily
	;;        activities.
