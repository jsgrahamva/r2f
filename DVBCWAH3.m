	;;        other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefit purposes, means
	;;        that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable of

	;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
	;;        manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
	;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
	;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
	;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills
	;;        himself or herself?
	;;
	;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is capable
	;;        of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
	;;        support your conclusion.
	;;
	;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before you
	;;        can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his or her
	;;        financial affairs, please explain why.
