	;FB*3.5*161 Patient MRA delete from MRA Transmission file 
	;           161.26 when linked patient authorization is
	;           deleted. Had to move DELB as separate call from 
	;           DELA tag (checks for allowing delete) so the 
	;           patient MRAs are only deleted when the user 
	;           actually can respond 'YES' to delete query.
	;           Linked to FROM DATE x-ref xxxx which calls this
	;           delete process when authorization is fully deleted.
